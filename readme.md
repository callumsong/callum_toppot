# The Top Pot Simulation Project

## For this project the inputs are the following:

- Area name (e.g. "Downtown")
- Minumum foot traffic per hour
- Maximum foot traffic per hour
- Percentage of people that will come in (as a whole number)
- The number of donuts they will consume

The current one only does one simulation - there will be another version that adds as many simulations as the user wishes.

Here are the first test results of my readme:

Based on the simulation, Downtown will sell 8131 donuts today. There will be 739 donuts needed per hour

Based on the simulation, Capitol Hill will sell 1633 donuts today. There will be 148 donuts needed per hour

Based on the simulation, South Lake Union will sell 8167 donuts today. There will be 742 donuts needed per hour

Based on the simulation, Wedgewood will sell 1960 donuts today. There will be 178 donuts needed per hour

Based on the simulation, Ballard will sell 4671 donuts today. There will be 424 donuts needed per hour

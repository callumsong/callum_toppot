# The Top Pot Simulation Project

## For this project the inputs are the following:

- Area name (e.g. "Downtown")
- Minumum foot traffic per hour
- Maximum foot traffic per hour
- Percentage of people that will come in (as a whole number)
- The number of donuts they will consume

The current one only does one simulation - there will be another version that adds as many simulations as the user wishes.

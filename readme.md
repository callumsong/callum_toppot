# The Top Pot Simulation Project

## For this project the inputs are the following:

- Area name (e.g. "Downtown")
- Minumum foot traffic per hour
- Maximum foot traffic per hour
- Percentage of people that will come in (as a whole number)
- The number of donuts they will consume

This particular version allows the user to input how many times they would like to run the simulation, for more accuracy.

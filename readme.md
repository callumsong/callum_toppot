# The Top Pot Simulation Project

## For this project the inputs are the following:

- Area name (e.g. "Downtown")
- Minumum foot traffic per hour
- Maximum foot traffic per hour
- Percentage of people that will come in (as a whole number)
- The number of donuts they will consume

This particular version allows the user to input how many times they would like to run the simulation, for more accuracy.

One test run results as follows:

Based on 20  simulation(s), Downtown will sell 7163 donuts today. There will be 651 donuts needed per hour

Based on 20  simulation(s), Capitol Hill will sell 1415 donuts today. There will be 128 donuts needed per hour

Based on 20  simulation(s), South Lake Union will sell 8639 donuts today. There will be 785 donuts needed per hour

Based on 20  simulation(s), Wedgewood will sell 1343 donuts today. There will be 122 donuts needed per hour

Based on 20  simulation(s), Ballard will sell 4711 donuts today. There will be 428 donuts needed per hour
